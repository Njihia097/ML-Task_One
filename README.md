**Office Price Prediction - Linear Regression Model**

This project implements a simple Linear Regression model to predict office prices based on office sizes using Gradient Descent as the learning algorithm. The Nairobi Office Price Ex dataset is used, with x representing office size and y representing office price. Key features include Mean Squared Error calculation for performance measurement and Gradient Descent for training the model over a set number of epochs.
